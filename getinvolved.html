				<h1>Get to know more about our campaigns. Please check the video below</h1>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7flD7gyTvMw">I added this video here.</a> It is from 2022. This was our first biggest campagin outside of Dhaka and took place in Sirajganj, a village in Rangpur. The weather is really harsh over there and the clothes/blankets which was donated by you helped the underpriviledged people a lot. Thank you for your continuous support and donations. We appreciate it.
